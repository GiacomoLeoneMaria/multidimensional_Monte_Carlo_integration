We will implement some algorithms for numerical quadrature, that is, for the calculation of definite integrals of functions in a closed interval and the evaluation of the error committed in the calculation of the integral itself. This is necessary when we do not know how to evaluate analytically the integral under consideration, when we cannot express the primitive in elementary functions, when the analytical solution is very complicated and the numerical calculation is much simpler.

The implemented methods consist of:
Mid-Point method
Simpson method
Trapezoids formula with fixed and unfixed precision

For convenience we will integrate the function sin(x).
